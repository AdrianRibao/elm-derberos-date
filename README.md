# elm-derberos-date

This library provide some functions to work with the new Time api. It uses the posix time as a base for all the calculations.

It is based on the wonderful paper from Howard Hinnant http://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html.

Inspired also by [Elm date extra](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rluiten/elm-date-extra/9.4.)
